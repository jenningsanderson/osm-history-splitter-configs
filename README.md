Bounds for Splitting OSM History Files
======================================

Originally Forked from: [MaZderMind/osm-history-splitter](https://github.com/MaZderMind/osm-history-splitter)

Note that under user ```osm```, the command can be run with the shortcut ```osm-splitter```

This git repo lives on the osm-epic virtual machine:

	/home/osm/osm-history-splitter-configs

The tool can be run simply with:

	python tools/split-all-clipbounds.py

It will hierarchically split files in the ```clipbounds``` directory.  The ```clipbounds-no_run``` directory is an archive of existing bounds.
